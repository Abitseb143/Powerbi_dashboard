📊 Power BI Beginner Dashboard



🌟 Introduction

Hello there! 👋 This repository showcases my beginner-level Power BI dashboard project. I built this as a way to apply and practice data visualization skills, transforming raw data into meaningful, interactive insights. Think of it as my personal data playground — and now I’m sharing it with you.



📝 Description

In this dashboard, I focused on taking a straightforward dataset (included in the .pbix file) and turning it into something engaging and informative. The aim was to:

- Clean and shape the data

- Build a simple, logical data model

- Design visuals that are easy to interpret

- Add interactivity through slicers and filters

- Practice best practices for layout and color design

The project demonstrates the essential skills needed to kickstart any Power BI journey, while keeping the design simple enough for others to learn from.



🛠️ Tech Stack

- Power BI Desktop (for data modeling, DAX, and visualization)

- Power Query for data transformation and cleaning

- Data modeling techniques to set up relationships between tables

- Good old creativity to tie it all together visually!


  

🕵️‍♂️ Problem Walkthrough

The challenge was to take a beginner-level dataset (often messy and unstructured) and tell a clear story through visuals. I asked myself:

How do I organize the data to make it easier to explore?

Which KPIs would be most useful?

How can I make the dashboard intuitive for users, even if they’ve never seen the data before?

First, I loaded the data and cleaned it with Power Query to remove inconsistencies. Then, I built a simple star schema to make sure relationships were correct. After that, I created calculated measures in DAX to produce meaningful metrics.




🎨 Key Visuals

Here’s what I included in the dashboard:

✅ KPI Cards — to show high-level metrics at a glance
✅ Bar charts — to compare categories and spot trends
✅ Line charts — to show changes over time
✅ Interactive slicers — so users can filter data as they like
✅ Tables — to let users drill into details
✅ Consistent color theme — to improve readability and make it visually appealing

Each visual was placed with purpose, making sure the dashboard flows logically from summary to detail.
